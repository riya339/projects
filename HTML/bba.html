      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <br>
      

    Finance is a term broadly describing the study and system of money, investments, and other financial instruments.
    Finance can be divided broadly into three distinct categories: public finance, corporate finance, and personal finance.
    More recent subcategories of finance include social finance and behavioral finance.
    The history of finance and financial activities dates back to the dawn of civilization. Banks and interest-bearing loans existed as early as 3000 BC. Coins were being circulated as early as 1000 BC.
    While it has roots in scientific fields, such as statistics, economics, and mathematics, finance also includes non-scientific elements that liken it to an art.

      <h3 style="text-align: left;">Week 1:</h3>Introduced to three basic forms to organize a business based on the nature of the business and its financing needs.
       Examining the goal of financial business helps us to develop a concrete framework to evaluate a corporate manager’s financial decisions. The corporation organization
       form is widespread because it can solve problems facing big business, but it also incurs the agency cost. You will also learn about some strategies companies are using to mitigate the agency problem.

      <div class="Syllabus" id="w2">
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Week 2:</h3>This module, you will learn the basics of financial statements. The balance sheet captures the assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity of a company.
         The income statement is used to show profit and loss. You will explore the link between these two financial statements. You will also learn how to derive cash flows from financial statements, and the
         sources and uses of cash flow. 
        </div>
        <div class="Syllabus" id="w3">
          <h3 style="text-align: left;">Week 3:</h3>This module is the application of financial statements. You will be introduced to the concept of standardized statements. You will learn how to conduct ratio 
          analysis to evaluate the financial health of a company. In addition, you will use financial ratios to measure the liquidity of the company, the leverage of the company, the profitability of the company,
          and the asset management of the company.

          <div class="Syllabus" id="w4">
            <h3 style="text-align: left;">Week 4:</h3>In this module, you will be introduced to the basic concepts about the time value of money: the present value, the future value, and the net present value. You 
            will also examine the difference between the quoted interest rate and effective annual rate. Two explicit patterns of cash flow will be studied in detail: annuity and perpetuity. There are widespread
           applications of time value of money in our daily life and business valuation. Some examples include mortgage plan selection, pension plan choice, and investment decisions.
